# Databases Used in PanViTa
PanViTa utilizes four main databases for analyzing antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors in bacterial genomes. 
Each database has specific characteristics that complement pan-genomic analysis. Details for each are below:

## [BacMet - Antibacterial Biocide & Metal Resistence Genes Database](mailto:http://bacmet.biomedicine.gu.se/)

**What is it?**
BacMet is a database focused on biocide and heavy metal resistance genes in bacteria. 
It contains information on genes that confer resistance to compounds such as mercury, copper, silver, and other non-antibiotic antimicrobial agents.

**Why use it in PanViTa?**
- Environmental resistance: Identifies genes associated with resistance to heavy metals, common in hospital and industrial environments.

- Complementarity: Expands resistance analysis beyond antibiotics to include disinfectants and metals.

## [CARD - The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database](malito:https://card.mcmaster.ca/)

**What is it?**
CARD is a comprehensive database of antibiotic resistance genes, including mechanisms such as enzyme inactivation, efflux, and target modification.

**Why use it in PanViTa?**
- Gold standard: Widely used for antimicrobial resistance analysis.

- Detailed: Provides information on resistance mechanisms and affected antibiotic classes.

## [VFDB - Virulence Factors Database](malito:https://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/main.htm)

**What is it?**
The VFDB catalogs bacterial virulence genes, such as toxins, adhesins, and secretion systems, essential for pathogenicity.

**Why use it in PanViTa?**
- Pathogenicity analysis: Identifies factors that contribute to bacterial virulence.

- Detailed mechanisms: Classifies genes by function (e.g., invasion, immune evasion).

## [MegaRes - Antimicrobial Resistance Database for High-Throughput Sequencing](malito:https://www.meglab.org/megares/)

**What is it?**
MEGARes is a database focused on antibiotic resistance genes, including point mutations and genes acquired through HGT (Horizontal Gene Transfer).

**Why use it in PanViTa?**
- Broad coverage: Includes resistance to antibiotics, biocides, and metals.

- Frequent updates: Stays up-to-date with recent discoveries in resistance.

## Integration into PanViTa

**PanViTa combines these databases for:**
- Pan-genomic analysis: Identifies core (common) and accessory (variable) genes related to resistance and virulence.
- Visualization: Generates heatmaps, scatter plots, and statistical analyses to compare profiles across genomes.
- Biological context: Correlates genes with resistance/virulence mechanisms and compound classes.
- This multi-database approach enables robust characterization of the pathogenic and resistant potential of bacteria, useful in clinical, environmental, and epidemiological surveillance studies.

**You can implement databases of your choice and integrate them with PanViTa. Or you can send us trusted databases containing data for analysis, so we can integrate them with PanViTa in the future.**
